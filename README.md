# 🧠 Math API – Internship Test Backend Project

This project was created as part of an **Internship Test Backend Assignment**.  
It includes two simple APIs built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** to perform basic mathematical computations — **Pythagoras Theorem (Trigonometry)** and **Quadratic Equation Solver**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Two separate math APIs:
  1. **/api/triangle** → Calculates hypotenuse using Pythagoras theorem  
  2. **/api/quadratic** → Solves quadratic equation and returns both roots  
- Input validation & error handling  
- Fast and lightweight Express server  
- Tested with Postman  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Node.js**  
- **Express.js**  
- **Math module (JavaScript)**  
- **Postman** for API testing
